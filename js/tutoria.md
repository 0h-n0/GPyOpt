The purpose of this manual is to provide a guide to use GPyOpt. The framework is BSD-3 licensed and we welcome collaborators to develop new functionalities. If you have any question or suggestions about the notebooks, please contact (Javier Gonzalez) j.h.gonzalez@sheffield.ac.uk. For general questions about the package please write an issue in the GitHub repository.

There are several options implemented in GPyOpt that allows to cover a wide range of specific optimization problems. We have implemented a collection of notebooks to explain these functionalities separately but they can be easily combined.
