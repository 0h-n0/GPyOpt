# TODO list to improve GPyOpt   
# 10/11/2014

# 
# Big additions
#

- Finish the implementation of ES
- Add Multi-task optimization (contact Tudor for this)
- Add Batch optimization (new ideas and well as the Azimi update). Potential for paralellizaion here
- Add a commamd line interface (usefull for the optimization of physical experiments).



#
# Small addtions
#

- remove the dependencies from scitools
- (DONE, renamed as max_iter) Clarify that H refers the horizont (number of samples to be taken)
- (DONE) Add an option to select the number of restats in the optimization of the parameters in the GP.
- (DONE) Add an option to select after how many interations the parameters of the GP shoulb be updated.
- Plot the variances as a var plot instead of using confidence bands.
- (DONE)Implement a last-step pure exploration.
- (DONE)Implement stopping criteria (distance between the two last consecutive time points?)
- (DONE) in 1D cases, add vertical lines in the plots where the optimum is.
- Flag to plot the true function if available.
- Robust test. Sometimes it is instable (when two data points are very close). Need to save the results before that happens.
- inlcude an option to change the model before start running the optimization.
- (DONE) normalize y
- (DONE) merge wrap functions for the three acquisitions 
- (DONE) include option to optimize the acquisition function using brute force or ramdominitializations.
