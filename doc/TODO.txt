# TODO list to improve GPyOpt   
# 14/11/2014

# 
# Big additions
#

- Start writting reference manual.
- Finish the implementation of ES.
- Add Multi-task optimization (contact Tudor for this)
- Add Batch optimization (new ideas and well as the Azimi update). Potential for paralellizaion here.
- Add a commamd line interface (usefull for the optimization of physical experiments).


#
# Small addtions
#

- add default function for phisical experiment
- check the option to change the sign of the function to maximize
- remove the dependencies from scitools
- Flag to plot the true function if available.
- Robust test. Sometimes it is instable (when two data points are very close). Need to save the results before that happens (solved with stopping condition)
