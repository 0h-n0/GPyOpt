GPyOpt examples
======

The goal of this set of examples is to show how to GPyOpt can be used in a similar way to Spearmint (https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint). The default options that GPyOpt uses in the config .json files are idential to those used by Spearmint. 

Just some small differences that aim to address in the future:

* So far only objective funtions written in pyton can be used.
* The parallelization of the evaluations is carried out in a synchronous way rather than asynchronous as it is done is Spearmint.
