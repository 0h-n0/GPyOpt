We are happy to announce the fist release of GPyOpt. Still a lot of work to do but base version with some basic functionalities is now pip installable. Among other functionalities with GPyOpt now can:

- Run Bayesian optimization with most standard acquisition functions.
- Compute batches to run experiments in parallel.
- Use Gaussian Processes and Sparse Gaussian processes as surrogate models.
