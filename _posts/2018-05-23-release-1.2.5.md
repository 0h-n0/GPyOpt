An update numbered 1.2.5 of GPyOpt has just been released, and is now available in our master branch, as well as via pip install.

It mostly contains various fixes our users have contributed to the code base over the past few months. Thank you for your support!

We have also introduced a new type of acquisition function called entropy search, implemented based on the paper by P. Henning and C. Schuler. The function is experimental, and we haven't put it through lots of testing, but there is a notebook illustrating how it can be used. Feel free to try it out.
