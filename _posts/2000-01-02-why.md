With GPyOpt you can:


1. **Solve global optimization problems**: Use Bayesian Optimization to solve global optimization problems using Gaussian processes as surrogate models. 

2. **Import GPy functionalities**: you can use any functionality of GPy in your optimization. Choose between a large variety of kernels, kernel combinations, likelihoods, etc.

3. **Run Parallel optimization**: make use of all your computational/physical resources by optimizing your funtion of interest in parallel or by designing batches of wetlab experiments.  

4. **Run Big Data optimization**: Use sparse Gaussian process and use Bayesian optimization with massive datasets.
